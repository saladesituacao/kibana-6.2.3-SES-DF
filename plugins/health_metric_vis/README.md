You can find the command for Windows [here](https://github.com/clamarque/Kibana_health_metric_vis/wiki#install-plugin-with-windows)

**Warning:** If you download or clone the directory directly, the installation will not work. In fact since kibana 5, it is necessary to put all the files under a folder empty called kibana (This does not apply to version 4).

## How to use

Click on the button **'Visualize'** and create a new visualization to select **'Health Metric'**

> In options, you can change the colors you want with hexadecimal color code **(#FFFFFF)** or by the color name **(white)**. If you change the color indicating the name of the color, the color indicator **will not update** and display **the black color by default**.

You can also specify a maximum threshold **(critical)** that is not exceeded but also an alert threshold **(warning)**. The color will be modified according to the state of health of the metric.
